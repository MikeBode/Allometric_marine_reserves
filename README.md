# Allometric_marine_reserves
Matlab code for predicting the combined benefits of MPAs &amp; harvest effort with explicit allometric dynamics

This code is meant to recreate a series of results and figures relevant to Marshall et al. (in prep). It is a spatial model of a harvested stock where a proportion of the habitat may be protected by a no-take marine reserve, and where the remaining proportion is exposed to effort-controlled harvesting.

See Central_command.m for an outline of the code.

Note, the root directory should include an empty folder called "Figures".
